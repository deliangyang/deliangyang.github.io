  "description": "This document details various BPF map types (e.g., BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY, BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH, BPF_MAP_TYPE_LRU_HASH, etc.), demonstrates how to define and use them in C code, including functions like bpf_map_lookup_elem, bpf_map_update_elem, and bpf_map_get_next_key for map manipulation and traversal.  It also provides examples of creating maps and iterating through their elements.",
