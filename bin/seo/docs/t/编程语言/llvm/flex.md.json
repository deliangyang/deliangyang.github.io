Without the content of the article about "flex scanner", it's impossible to provide accurate keywords, a description, and a title optimized for SEO.  I need the article text to do that.

However, I can give you a *template* assuming the article is about the Lex/Flex lexical analyzer generator:


{
  "keywords": ["flex", "lex", "scanner", "lexical analyzer", "lexer", "compiler", "compiler construction", "regular expressions", "finite automata", "tokenization", "parsing", "lexical analysis", "programming languages", "software development"],
  "description": "Learn about Flex, a powerful lexical analyzer generator used in compiler construction.  This guide covers regular expressions, finite automata, and the process of tokenization for building robust and efficient scanners.",
  "title": "Flex Scanner: A Comprehensive Guide to Lexical Analysis"
}

**To get a better JSON output, please provide the article text.**  I will then be able to extract relevant keywords, write a compelling description, and suggest a more accurate and SEO-friendly title.
