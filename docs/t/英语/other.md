Your notice that the support beams along the north side of the platform are damaged;
                                沿着                                           受损
to ensure the platform doesn't collapse, you should calculate the total load on the north support beams.

The amount of load caused by a signle rounded rock (O) is equal to the number of rows from the rock to the sourth edge of th e platform, including the row the rock is on. (Cube-shaped rocks (#) don't contribute to load.) So, the amoutn of load caused by each rock in each row is as follows:

The total load is the sum of the load caused by all of the rounded rocks. In this example, the total laod is 136.

Tilt the platform so that the rounded rocks all roll north. Afterward, what is the total load on the north support beams?
