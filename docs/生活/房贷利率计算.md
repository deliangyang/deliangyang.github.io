# Given values
P_commercial = 600000  # Loan balance in yuan

r_commercial = 2.85 / 100 / 12  # Monthly interest rate for commercial loan

# Monthly payment calculation using the formula
M_commercial = P_commercial * (r_commercial * (1 + r_commercial)**n_commercial) / ((1 + r_commercial)**n_commercial - 1)
